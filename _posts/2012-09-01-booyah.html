        <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">I'm normally all over the beer/pancake puns, but with a name like Booyah, I feel like it'd be an injustice to the beer and to any potential pun that I could come up with. Milwaukee Brewing Co's <a href="http://mkebrewing.com/beer/booyah/">Booyah</a>&nbsp;is a Belgian-style Farmhouse Ale that's apparently inspired by some type of soup that's made in the tiny town of De Pere, Wisconsin (as per the video on their webpage I just saw). Both the name and inspiration come from this varied-ingredient stew, and is more than just a beer - there're Booyah Parties, an entire event, county fair...I really lost track of what that guy was talking about. He broke his ankle watching a the Vikings beat the Packers or something. What? Sure.</span>

        <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">This particular bottle of Booyah came to me after a house party - someone had brought some over and I'd never heard of the stuff, but they wound up leaving it at our place, and with a name like Booyah, I couldn't resist. It's a light and flavorful ale with a lot of subtle undertones. I was a fan of it in liquid form (for a Farmhouse Ale, that is - I'll take any porter over any light ale any day), but the time came to see how it stacks up as a flapjack.</span>

        <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">The batter shared the delightful aroma of the beer, but colorwise/otherwise it had nothing special about it. You could probably, with proper mixture, pass this off as normal batter (considering batter's already kind of yeast-y) and get away with it. But why would you want to do that. Embrace the Booyah. Love the Booyah.</span>

            <div>
                <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Booyah came out looking and smelling like pretty standard pancakes. Unlike Spotted Cow, Booyah kept a bit of its flavors in pancake form, and didn't give much of a beery aftertaste. Unlike Leine's Summer Wheat, the pancaking process didn't really enhance the flavors at all. If anything, some of the subtlety that Booyah is known for was lost in the process.&nbsp;</span>
