When I first came across this beer, it was one of those things that I had to try. I was at <a href="http://starliquor.com" target="_blank">Star Liquor</a> one day looking through the cooler when I came across two interesting seasonals from <a href="http://www.3sheepsbrewing.com" target="_blank">3 Sheeps Brewing</a>. I don't even remember what the other one was, but I couldn't resist something called "Ginger Chocolate Stout".

The beer itself is wonderful. It's the perfect balance of gigner, cocoa, and dark malty stout. It literally tastes like a mouthful of ginger and cocoa nibs. I was shocked when I opened the first one. It was everything I'd hoped for and more. But, as with pretty much any beer I buy, I had to know what kind of pancakes it makes.

## Prep/Cooking

The batter (and the beer, I guess) was a little flat due to the fact that I'd actually opened this beer last night and didn't finish it for whatever sad/stupid reason, but aside from that nothing notable in terms of constitution.

In terms of flavor, the batter got a little sweeter than the beer was, which really brought out the ginger. Not in a bad way, per say, but it did ruin the delicate balance that made the beer so delightful. It tasted more like candy than a finely crafted beer.

## Results

This will definitely go down as one of the most interesting and incredible pancakes I've made in the history of this blog. Not that I really expected much else from such an interesting and incredible beer, but I was really floored. I expected something weird to happen during the process (as I've seen with a lot of other beers), but no, the delicate chocolate and ginger interplay remained fairly constant throughout the process. It was incredible.

## Ternary Scale

* Pancakes: 3. My notes from this entry literally say "O lawd. So good." The ginger wound up backing down a bit and the cocoa came through the flavor to get the same delightful balance found in the beer. Really phenomenal pancakes.
* Syrup: 2. I was actually worried the syrup would ruin these but it didn't. They were still great.
