        <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.stbcbeer.com/">Southern Tier</a> has a place near and dear to my heart, being a fellow product of Western New York. This entry also has a special place for me, as it was the hectic morning before the trip to Chicago to see the <a href="https://radicalsultimate.com/">Radicals</a> stomp the Windy City Wildfire for the <a href="http://theaudl.com/">Midwest Conference Championship</a>. That being said, this post is a few weeks late and we were largely in a rush that morning, so details might be a bit scarce (which is kind of sad given how interesting this beer is/good these pancakes were).</span>

            <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.stbcbeer.com/black-water/creme-brulee-beer-page/">Southern Tier's Creme Brulee Imperial Milk Stout</a>&nbsp;is without a doubt one of the most interesting beers you'll probably ever have. I'm never really a fan of milk stouts, but you just can't compare this to anything. It's dark, it's malty, it's sweet, and it's powerful. The beer pours a silky black with a light brown head, and from the second you crack open the bottle you can smell that sweet vanilla coming through.</span>

        <div>
            <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The batter itself came out to be one of the oddest batters I've seen. Obviously the color came through in the batter, as did the sweetness. I think that's what made it so weird/unique. Malty goodness? Check. Dark brown batter? Check. Vanilla bean sweetness? Wait, what? I also think the sheer volume set me off a little bit, as I'm used to making enough pancakes for a tasting for one, not to feed 3 for breakfast.</span>

        </h4>
        <div>
            <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The pancakes came out just as dark and sweet as one would expect. The first few tasted a little burnt (not surprisingly), but the flavor grew on me over time. We were really short on time, so I didn't quite get the chance to full explore the flavors, but overall the reaction was positive from the other two pancake-eaters. Sweet, but not overpoweringly so. Pretty great overall.</span>

        </h4>
        <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Pancakes: 1 - I wasn't as wowed by these pancakes as I was expecting to be. The reason I say make them is because that bomber of creme brulee is kind of a lot, and you probably won't want it anymore by the time you get about 3/4 the way through it. Pancakes are a great alternative to choking down sweet beer.</span>
        <br />
        <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Syrup: 0 - I didn't notice anything special about adding syrup to these. They're sweet enough as it is, and it's not like the syrup added anything or brought anything out in the taste.</span>
