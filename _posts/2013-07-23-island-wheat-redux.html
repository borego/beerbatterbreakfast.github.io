<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
    <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
        <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">So here's somewhat of a rare mistake on my part - I accidentally re-did a beer. Here's the skinny: a few weeks ago, I had a Remains of the Day post from Wisconsin Swiss that featured two beers from <a href="http://www.capital-brewery.com/">Capital Brewery</a> - their Amber and their Island Wheat. A few days ago, I was out at the pool with my buddies on a summer day, so I brought some Island Wheat. I had some leftover, so of course, what do I do? Make pancakes.
            <br />
            <br />When I went to write this up, though, I felt pretty dumb, as it's a beer we've seen before. That's okay, though, because it's one of the best pancake beers I've seen, so I'm going through with posting it anyway. Boom.</span>

        <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">

                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">
                        <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">And it's in a can!</span>
                    </td>

        </table>
        <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The beer, as described before, is light but flavorful. It's pretty ideal in terms of a poolside/summertime drink, as it's crisp and refreshing but still has a lot of flavor. It's even better when it's cold and not flat (which is much unlike the last time we encountered it).</span>
        <br />
        <h4 style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Prep/Cooking:</span>
        </h4>
        <div>
            <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The batter itself came out crazy light in color. Not that the beer is dark at all, but this is almost definitely the lightest batter we've seen. There weren't any interesting aromas to it, nor was there a ton of flavor, so really nothing interesting on the batter front. The pancakes cooked up pretty much normal as well.</span>
        </div>
        <h4>
            <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Results:</span>
        </h4>
        <div>
            <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I've said it before and I'll say it again - wheat beer tends to make really good pancakes. This beer is no different. In fact, this beer may as well be the flagship wheat pancake beer. I took my first bite and was instantly transported to a world of delightful wheat pancake love. It's a difficult taste to describe, but boy is it good.</span>

            </tbody>
        </table>
        <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">One other thing worth noting is the color of these pancakes. This is probably the lightest color of pancake I've ever seen (well, maybe aside from normal ones, but who eats those anymore). Again, not shocking, but notable.</span>

                <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Pancakes: 2! Oh god, yes. Go buy some of this beer (it's pretty cheap) and make pancakes. Make all the pancakes. It's decent in beer form but oh man, pancake it up.</span>

            <div>
                <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Syrup: 0. Don't bother. I mean, it's not bad with syrup by any means, but don't ruin the wonder and amazement that are these pancakes on their own. They don't need any help.</span>
