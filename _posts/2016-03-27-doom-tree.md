Doomtree is one of those beers that people ooh and aah about when you show up at certain events. Maybe it's the shiny can, maybe it's that it's a "one-off". I picked this up on a whim because I heard good things about it. But, of course, any beer that enters this house must become pancakes.

<a href="http://surlybrewing.com/beer/doomtree/" target="_blank">Doomtree</a> is, according to Surly themselves, a "bastardized style". BeerAdvocate calls it an American Pale Ale, which I guess I agree with. The beer has a delightful malt backbone with hints of sweetness balanced by notches of hops. As Surly puts it, it's "dark gold, toasty, aromatic, subtly spicy, bitter enough, dry-hopped brew".

## Prep/Cooking

Doomtree batter took on some interesting characteristics. Notably, it got a lot sweeter. Or, possibly, it lost some of the malt and hop bitterness to balance it out, and some of the spice came through a bit more. It had a somewhat bready feel to it. The other interesthing thing was how thick it got once it sat for a little. I'm guessing that has something to do with how heady the beer is, but I don't think I've ever seen anything like it.

## Results

For all the pomp and circumstance the beer gets, and the potentially interesting batter characteristics, the pancakes themselves were underwhelming. The hoppiness died off completely, but there was a sense of subtle malt in the aftertaste. Otherwise, there wasn't much going on with these pancakes.

## The Decision

* Pancakes: No. Stick with the beer &ndash; it's not my favorite, but it's still better than pancakes.
* Syrup: No. Syrup didn't change much here. The aftertaste lost its subtlety and picked up some bitterness. Otherwise it just washed out any other flavors.
