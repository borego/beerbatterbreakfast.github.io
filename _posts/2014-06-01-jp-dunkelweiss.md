I love doing posts about homebrews. It's completely pointless for the vast majority of the audience, but it's always fun to do something special with something special someone special gave to you. Today's entry is a bottle I've been sitting on for awhile - all the way back to <a href="http://madisoncurlingclub.com" target="_blank">curling</a> season. One of my good curling buddies JP gave me a few bottles of a Dunkelweiss he made a few months ago, so naturally it becomes pancakes.

This dunkelweiss comes in with a crisp, light wheaty flavor and beautiful golden color. The aroma gives hints of biscuit and very lightly hopped (aka barely at all). Surprising for JP, who's a huge hop head, but perfect for someone like me.

## Prep/Cooking

One of the first things I noticed about both the aroma and flavor of this batter is how much more those biscuit notes came through. I'm going to go out on a limb and guess there was some biscuit malt in here (JP? Confirm/deny?), but man did this get sweet and almost chewy in flavor. Quite delightful, actually.

As with most wheat beers, the DW kept a lot of its sweetness and wheat flavors (though less than some of the other wheat beers I've covered). Overall the pancakes were pretty solid - maybe even moreso than the beer. Definitely enjoyable, but nothing mind-blowing. Syrup didn't do much for these; it didn't ruin them but it didn't really help, either. The sweetness just kind of masked the flavor, which in my book is a waste of both syrup and good beer pancakes.

## Ternary Scale

As with other homebrews, I'm going to break format. As a homebrew, you'll likely never get your hands on this, so making a recommendation as to whether or not you should make pancakes out of is silly. I would like to take this time to thank JP for the bottles, and encourage all of you out there to get into homebrewing. It's awesome.
