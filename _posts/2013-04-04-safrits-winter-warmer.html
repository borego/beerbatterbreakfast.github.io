        <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Whew, as it turns out, making beer pancakes with normal pancake mix is actually kind of difficult. Where does the substitution come in? Is it the milk? The egg? Not as straightforward as I thought. As a result, we fell off the bandwagon a bit here, going about a month without updates - sorry about that!</span>
        <br />
        <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">
            <br />
        </span>
        <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The good news is that we're back and better than ever (well, at least as good as before). We've got a new box of pancake mix, and we're kicking things off with a beer that's about to go out of season - the Winter Warmer.</span>

        <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">A creation of the wonderful Alex Safrit, this Winter Warmer features a little bit of spice, a lot of wonderful caramel tones, and a little wintery goodness with Juniper seed. I've had this beer in my fridge since about January, and given Spring is on the horizon, I felt it was about time to put her to rest. And, of course, what better way to do that than pancakes?!</span>

        </h4>
        <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The Winter Warmer poured a foamy-yet-quick-to-subside dark amber, and has a wonderfully caramel flavor with the hint of spice and Christmas (aka juniper). In batter form, nothing changed much. If anything, we maybe lost a bit of the juniper, overrun by the stronger flavors in the beer and of the batter.</span>

        <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">While the batter had settled by the time the picture was taken, the pancakes showed the bubbliness of this brew in cooking, and came out the other side a little darker than normal pancakes, but certainly not the <a href="http://ccbbp.blogspot.com/2012/07/bluebeery-pancakes.html">strangest</a>  <a href="http://ccbbp.blogspot.com/2013/01/komodo-dragonfly.html">color</a> we've seen on this blog.</span>

        </h4>
        <div>
            <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">While the loss of juniper was again true in pancake form, the spice and caramel tones really came through in pancake form, making a delightful-yet-flavorful flapjack. Next time you get your hands on a winter warmer (which, at this point, will likely be many months from now), give it a shot at the pancake world.</span>

        <div>
            <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I'm actually going to break format on this one because this section would be totally pointless. As a homebrew, you'll likely never get your hands on this, so making a recommendation as to whether or not you should make pancakes out of is silly. I would like to take this time to thank Alex for the bottle, and encourage all of you out there to get into homebrewing. It's awesome.</span>
