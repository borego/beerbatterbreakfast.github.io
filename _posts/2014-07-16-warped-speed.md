Arguably one of their most popular/famous beers, Warped Speed is a delightful Scotch Ale from Lake Louie Brewing Company out of Arena, WI, just a little West of Madison.

Warped Speed is probably most famous for its alcohol content (which is also possibly its namesake?), clocking in at 7.2% ABV. It's a delightfully malty, somewhat sweet beer with a definitively boozy taste to it as well. It can be a little abrasive at times, especially when it's warm, but it certainly makes some interesting pancakes.

## Prep/Cooking

I was first (and most) stricken by the color of the batter. The beer pours a deep amber color, but for some reason almost none of that stuck around for the batter. In terms of taste, the batter was slightly sweeter than the beer (which is already almost too sweet), but virtually all of the boozy notes of the beer disapepared, making it a lot easier to handle than in beer form.

## Results

I wasn't sure what to expect of these pancakes, especially when I first started with the beer. The batter gave a little inkling, but what I was expecting didn't at all measure up to these pancakes. The sweetness of the batter fell off and the malty caramel came through a lot more. The bite of the alcohol in beer form was virtually nonexistent as well, making the pancakes way more palatable than the beer.

## Ternary Scale

* Pancakes: 3. I'm pretty sure I'd take the pancakes over the beer pretty much any day.
* Syrup: 1. It didn't really help or harm here. I don't think it's worth it from that standpoint.
