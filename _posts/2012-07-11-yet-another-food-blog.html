<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
    <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
        <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">First things first - credit where credit's due. Not that there <a href="http://chrisbadenoch.com/2010/03/04/beer-pancakes/">aren't</a>. <a href="http://www.stetted.com/index.php/2011/04/28/beer-pancakes/">a ton</a>. <a href="http://captainjaxestreasureisland.blogspot.com/2008/08/beer-pancakes.html">of</a>. <a href="http://beerpancakes.blogspot.com/">other</a>. <a href="http://thebeeroness.com/2012/04/17/beer-and-brown-sugar-pancakes/">people</a>. <a href="http://www.chow.com/recipes/10940-campfire-beer-pancakes">making</a>. beer pancakes, but the ones who <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZDv9pgHp8Q">originally inspired me</a> personally and gave me the idea are none other than the wonderful people over at <a href="http://www.epicmealtime.com/">Epic Meal Time</a>. Technically an adaptation of the original (Chocolate Chip Bacon Beer Waffles), I immediately fell in love with the idea of beer batter pancakes.</span>
        <br />
        <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
            <br />
        </span>
        <br />
        <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There're two problems I have with the current beer pancake offerings available on the web:</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <ol style="text-align: left;">
            <li>
                <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">They're almost all out-of-date/not current</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Almost all of the recipes call for some horrible, flavorless, light American lager</span>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div>
            <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The latter point is exactly the mistake I made the first time I tried this (Coors doesn't make good pancakes). After giving it a second try (Leine's Summer Wheat makes good pancakes) I decided there's learning to be had here, and the only way to do so is to experiment with all of the wonderful beers out there.</span>
        </div>
        <div>
            <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
                <br />
            </span>
        </div>
        <div>
            <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Expect to see before, during, and after shots as well as descriptions of the beer of choice and the resulting pancakes. I'd like to update this about once a week, but given my <a href="http://trinkerapp.com/">entrepreneurial alter-ego</a>, I can't make any guarantees.</span>
