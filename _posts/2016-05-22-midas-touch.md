I always get really excited about verticals on this blog, and we've already had a few (just search "vertical" on the sidebar), but I'm always happy to introduce another. New Glarus's annual sour (though it's no Enigma) has made <a href="/2014/08/oud-bruin.html">one prior appearance</a> on this blog and I was happy to be able to bring it back again this year. Let's see how it fares!

<a href="http://www.newglarusbrewing.com/index.cfm/beers/ourbeers/beer/oud-bruin">Oud Bruin</a> is one of New Glarus Brewing Company's "thumbprint" series - brews that aren't exactly seasonal, aren't exact rotational, but are all pretty incredible. Oud Bruin is more of a traditional Flanders Red style that features a delightfully balanced tart sour with cherry notes. The fruit flavors don't overwhelm a strong red/brown ale style body. Really a great beer overall.

## Prep/Cooking

The batter was surprisingly thick given how easily-drinkable the beer is, and it has a pleasant light brown color. At first, the batter tasted nothing like the beer, but had an oddly biscuity flavor. After a few tastes, I was able to adapt, and it developed a lightly fruity finish. Not sour at all, but overall really nice.

## Results

My first impression of these pancakes was a wonderful cherry aroma. It was subtle (like all of the fruit flavors have been throughout), but I immediately picked up on it. Flavor-wise, again, at first there wasn't a very strong Oud Bruin-esque flavor, but after a few bites my taste buds adapted and the pancakes developed a wonderful cherry finish to go with a nice malty backbone. Still not sour, but they left a crisp, fresh feeling.

## The Decision

* Pancakes: Yes. I'm remiss to say make pancakes out of this beer because how good the beer is, but that's not fair to hold it against the pancakes. They were subtle throughout but a really pleasant experience.
* Syrup: Yes. Something about the sweetness of the syrup finally brought the fruit flavors to the forefront. At the same time, it didn't overpower the pancake flavor. I had exactly one bite that had slight hint of funk to it, but that may've just been my brain substituting associations...
